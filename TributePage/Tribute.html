Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ( born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, 
regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up 
cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to 
represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred 
international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both 
Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.
